CustomerName,Review
Richard N.,"My first Android device, using it a month and so far meeting all my needs well. Good battery life, v clear screen, brilliant colors! Great sound too. Bought a protective case as well, fitted very well! TQ"
Ng,"Bought it for 370 SGD on sale. I have seen prices as low as 330 SGD. At that price, this tablet is very worth it. Plus this is the 2022 version with updated snapdragon processor as it is the US model. Pen works very well so far and battery life is excellent."
Jhana LSH,"Helped someone in my household get this. After a few uses, the feedback is that it is totally value for money."
Koenig168,"Looks great. Display is bright and crisp. Tablet is responsive and battery life is good.

Only negative is that the sound from headphone jack is muddy and can get tinny at higher frequencies. Tested using the same buds on a Samsung mobile and the S6 Lite and the difference in quality is very obvious. Samsung should have used a better internal DAC."
Daviddd,"Got it as a gift. No lag in browsing or watching videos. The added S Pen is really nice and reason to choose this over other options.

Setup took abit long as I think there are plenty of updates being done in the background."
Azwin,Came in good condition and happy with the purchase! Thank you so much!
Garfield,"tablets with writing pen included tend to be expensive
this one was obtained on sale and I got it for a song
we used to go to the mall a lot mostly for my wife's shopping
I would bring my girls to the local Challenger IT store as IT is my kind of stuff
my daughters would end up drawing on the Ipad or the Samsung display sets with pen
Made me want to buy one of these
But when I finally got them this, they have somehow outgrown doodling in matter of two, three years
luckily, they still use it regularly to play pokemon games so I still feel my purchase is well worth it"
Amazon Customer,"Got it during sale. Really worth it! The blue color is pretty too.

The fountain pen function on Samsung notes makes my handwriting look nicer than other stylus I've used so far"
Amazon customer,"High quality tablet, have used it for a few months now. Recommend it for the big screen, solid device overall."
RegretBuyingThis,A bit heavy. I expected it have second screen feature. Buth they have removed it and made it only available to >S7.
